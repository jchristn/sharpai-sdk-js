# JavaScript SDK for SharpAI

## Features

## Requirements

- Node.js v18.20.4
- npm

### Dependencies

- `jest` - for testing
- `msw` - for mocking the api
- `superagent` - for making the api calls

### Pre-commit Hooks

The pre-commit hooks will run automatically on `git commit`. They help maintain:

- Code formatting (using ruff)
- Import sorting
- Code quality checks
- And other project-specific checks

### Running Tests

The project uses `jest` for running tests in isolated environments. Make sure you have jest installed, which should automatically be there if you have installed dependencies via `npm i` command:

```bash
# Run only the tests
npm run test

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

```
